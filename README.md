This is a programming language that was first intended to be esoteric, but ended up actually usable (a bit).
I'll continue to update this so long as I am not bored and or dead. Soon, I will be creating documentation on this very github page.
Release 2.0.0 has been released, please submit bug reports so I know why I'm dumb.
