# C Double-Flat
*My most monstrous creation yet.*

This is a programming language that was first intended to be esoteric, but ended up actually usable (a bit).
I'll continue to update this so long as I am not bored and or dead. Soon, I will be creating documentation on this very Github page.
Release 2.2.0 has now been released, please submit bug reports so I know why I'm dumb.

Syntax and documentation can be found [in the wiki](/wiki)
